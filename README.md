# STX Impact Grants

STX Impact Grants is a decentralized grant management platform built on the Stacks blockchain. It is designed to facilitate transparent, verifiable, and efficient funding for social impact projects. By utilizing smart contracts, the platform ensures that every STX contributed goes directly to projects that drive real-world change.

## Key Features

* **Transparent Grant Allocation:** Every transaction, from donation to disbursement, is recorded permanently on the Stacks blockchain.
* **Impact Verification:** Projects must provide cryptographic or data-driven proof of impact to unlock funding tiers.
* **Direct-to-Project Funding:** Minimizes administrative overhead by connecting donors directly with grassroots initiatives.
* **Multi-Wallet Support:** Full integration with Hiro, Xverse, and WalletConnect v2.

## Unique Innovation: The Milestone & Trust Protocol

To ensure maximum accountability for social impact, we are introducing several proprietary concepts:

### 1. Milestone-Locked Escrow
Instead of lump-sum transfers, grants are held in a secure Clarity-based escrow. Funding is released in "Impact Waves" only after a project completes specific milestones. This protects donors and ensures sustained project momentum.

### 2. Community Peer Review
Leveraging the decentralized nature of the Stacks community, project progress is reviewed by a circle of "Impact Scouts." These scouts verify real-world outcomes before the next phase of funding is triggered.

### 3. Proof of Contribution (PoC)
Donors receive on-chain metadata updates that reflect the specific impact their contribution made (e.g., "Funded 100 Trees" or "Supported 50 Students"). This creates a lasting digital legacy of the donor's philanthropic footprint.
